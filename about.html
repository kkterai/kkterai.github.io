<p>About me? Thanks for asking. A sometime Medical Device Global Product Manager and competitive athlete, I became enamored with online business after starting my own online retail company and consulting for a Big Data Startup. </p>

<p>And then I found Flatiron School and signed up for a life-changing journey. I love Web Development, especially when it comes to ReactJS/Redux and Rails. My wish is to combine my knowledge and experience to deliver the best results to clients. I also love coffee. In short, I am: </p>

<p>1. Passionate (I love what I do) 
<br />2. Enthusiastic (I want to learn) 
<br />3. Skeptical (I think critically) 
<br />4. Focused (I have the right attitude)</p>

<p>I enjoy travel and have had the pleasure of exploring many US States and 16 other countries. When I’m not looking at a computer screen, you will find me outdoors, cooking, spending time with family, or listening to music – maybe even all at once.</p>

<p>You can find me here and over there: https://medium.com/@kenlynterai</p>
