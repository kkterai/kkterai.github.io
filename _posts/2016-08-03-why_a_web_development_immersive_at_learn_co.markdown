Before joining Flatiron's online full stack web development program, I had worked in Global Product Management for a large Medical Device company, as a Director of a small medical device company, and worked as a Product Managment contractor with projects in both Medical Devices and Technology. As I continued to enhance my Product Management skill base with Pragmatic Marketing and Association of International Product Marketing and Management (AIPMM) certifications, I was introduced to the rapid product development cycles of technology products.

It was at this point that I realized that there are endless possibilities to use tech to better the world - and with a relatively short time between market research, conception, planning, and release! I discovered that Computer Science, and Web Development in particular, offered opportunities to play to my strengths. And living in a Tech Center like Seattle, there would be companies I could help and also advance my career.

In short, my passion for problem-solving, desire to innovate, respect for hard work, and love of technology has led me to learn Full Stack Web Development. I am loving every minute of the process!
