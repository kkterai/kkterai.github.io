Ruby follows both [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) and object-oriented programming paradigms. Having completed the procedural portion, I’m delving into Object-Oriented Ruby.

According to Wikipedia, “[Object-oriented programming (OOP) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects“, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.” 

To paraphrase Avi Flombaum at around 8:50 in his [Intro to OO talk](http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ruby/Intro.to.OO.ruby.LV.mp4):

In Ruby, objects in general can do a lot “out of the box” due to inheritance because:

* [A class that I define] is really an instance of a class
* A class is an instance of an object
* Everything in Ruby descends out of objects
* Objects are built with a base functionality

You can find these “out of the box” methods at Ruby docs/[here](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/).
