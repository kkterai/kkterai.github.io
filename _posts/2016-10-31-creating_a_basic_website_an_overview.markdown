Within Flatiron’s Full stack web development program, I’ve had the opportunity to learn Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and am beginning to get an idea of its capabilities. [Creative Bloq](http://www.creativebloq.com/) has some gorgeous examples of websites created with HTML (see below).

Where does someone begin to create something like this? What is “Hypertext Markup Language” anyway? What makes it work? Here’s a brief summary:

**Markup Language**

As you read this blog, you are looking at your browser’s interpretation of the **markup language** (in this case, HTML) sent by the server.

> Markup language: a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the “marking up” of paper manuscripts when editing authors’ manuscripts in publishing. In digital media physical mark up was replaced by tags. Examples: HTML, CSS, DSSSL, XSL-FO, troff, XML, XLink, and XPath

**Using HTML **

Along with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, HTML is one of three key technologies for Web Development. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.

There are three components involved in creating a web page with HTML: 
1. Browser software: Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer’s additional use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
2. Server: Delivers HTML documents and other content by Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
3. HTML Document: Contains the markup that is interpreted by the browser. 

That’s it in its most basic form. Enjoy creating!
