After some mind-bending Ruby labs and great discussions around "self," a look at the concept is due. Helpful to readers? I hope so. Cathartic venting session? Definitely.

So, besides being the inescapable concept that Ruby mastery demands we understand, what is "self" anyway?

Starting with the negative, "self" **does not belong to a particular object**, so it cannot be assigned. Instead, it **points to the object** that "owns" the currently executing code. Most often you wonâ€™t need to use **self** explicitly, since you can call methods directly from inside other method definitions(1).

Here is a summary and some examples, below:

Elaborating on the use of **self** in modules:

I'll save the use of **self **in metaclasses for another post. In the meantime, coding on!
